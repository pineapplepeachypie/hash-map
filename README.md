# hash-map
This is a HashMap Implmentation using a Dynamic Array as the underlying data structure. The first one uses separate chaining and Linked Lists to handle collisions, while the second one uses open addressing and quadratic probing to handle collisions. 
The following methods are implemented in both classes:
put(), empty_buckets(), table_load(), clear(), resize_table(), get(), contains_key(), remove(), get_keys_and_values(). 
The find_mode() function is only in the SC, and the __iter__() and __next__() methods are only in the OA file.
